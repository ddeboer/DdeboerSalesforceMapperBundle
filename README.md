Ddeboer Salesforce Mapper Bundle
================================

Introduction
------------

This bundle provides transparent, object-oriented access to your Salesforce
data. 

### Features

* Easily fetch records from Salesforce, and save these same records back to
  Salesforce: read-only fields are automatically ignored when saving.
* Find by criteria, so you donâ€™t have to roll your own SOQL queries.
* Fetch related records in one go, so you save on
[API calls](http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api/Content/implementation_considerations.htm#topic-title_request_metering).
* Adjust the mappings to retrieve and save records exactly like you want to.
* The MappedBulkSaver helps you stay within your Salesforce API limits by using 
  bulk creates, deletes, updates and upserts for mapped objects.
* Completely unit tested (still working on that one).
